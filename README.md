# CA-and-Simulation-projects
Cellular Automota and other simulation projects should be built and maintained here.

A 1D CA with an arbitrary update rule has been implimented.

A 2D CA with selectable update strategies has been implimented.
By default, every cell incremented each generation.This is easily identifiable, uninteresting behavior that should only appear when an invalid update strategy has been selected.
